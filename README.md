- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the analysis.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the analysis:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Dataset
The BHP dataset used in this analysis should be placed in the `data/` directory. Ensure the dataset file is named appropriately to match the references in the notebook.
